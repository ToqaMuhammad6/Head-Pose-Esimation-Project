# Head-Pose-Esimation-Project
The project is to get the headpose from '2d' landmarks not 3d landmarks.. To do so with the classical way they have to fit the 2d points with a 3d  face model which is considered as a fitting technique. At the end, it is not a deterministic solution and has its problems. Here comes the ML to replace the 3d fitting assumption, the camera parameters and the  projection equations.
